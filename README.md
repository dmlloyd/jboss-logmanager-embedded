# README

This project now only serves as a historical record of the `jboss-logmanager-embedded` fork of the upstream [`jboss-logmanager`](https://github.com/jboss-logging/jboss-logmanager) project.

Referencing this project in Maven will produce a redirect to that project; however, no new releases of this project will be produced so this redirect only serves as a bridge for compatibility. New and existing projects should modify their POMs to refer to `jboss-logmanager` instead of this project.
